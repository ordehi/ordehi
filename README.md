## Joshua: Creating frictionless experiences through invisible infrastructure

I build solutions that remove friction from workflows rather than adding to them. My approach aligns with _calm technology_ principles: technology should adapt to people, not the other way around.

### 🎯 Philosophy

- **Solve at the periphery:** Address problems at the edge of user consciousness, like a good waiter refills your glass before you notice it's empty.
- **Subtractive over additive:** Remove steps from workflows. Why would I use your solution if it forces me to change a proven workflow I've committed to muscle memory? **Your software is not the gym.**
- **Reusable by design:** Every project generates value beyond its immediate goal (infrastructure, knowledge, concepts). **Failure != lost work.**
- **Understand before automating:** Question whether problems should be solved, not just how. If your first idea is to throw AI at a problem, you're likely skipping the actual problem-solving. **AI works best on solid foundations, or it can just make bad processes faster.**
- **Solve REAL problems users don't know they have:** The real challenge isn't building systems anymore, it's integrating into existing ones without breaking the user's flow. In a market where AI makes code output abundant, the differentiator is understanding deeper problems entrenched in modern human experience.

### ⚡ Approach

Prove your blocks are solid before building monuments. Keep research, planning, and building separate: context-switching is expensive. **Making your quarter inch drill read the Tarot won't make a better quarter inch hole.**

The best code I write is the code I don't have to write. Most solutions don't need new infrastructure, they need someone who can see what's already there and repurpose it. **Why pay for lumber when you're standing in a forest?**

I bring lessons from music, athletics, psychology, and philosophy into technical work. Cross-domain thinking isn't decoration, it's how you spot patterns others miss. The best solutions come from understanding human behavior, not just technical specs. **You don't think about your chair until it breaks. Bad technology demands attention. The best technology integrates.**

**Bragging about your tech stack in 2025 is like bragging about owning a calculator.**
