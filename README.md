## Joshua: Your software is not the gym

Shipped a space to generate shareholder value: https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/42137

I build solutions that remove friction from workflows rather than adding to them. My approach draws from [_calm technology_](https://calmtech.com/): technology should adapt to people, not the other way around.

**Bragging about your tech stack in 2025 is like bragging about owning a calculator.** I like working with JS flavors because they're accessible to write anywhere. Python because it zips from idea to solution in seconds. LLMs as extensions rather than shortcuts.

### 🎯 Principles

- **[Solve at the periphery](https://calmtech.com/papers/coming-age-calm-technology):** Address problems at the edge of user consciousness, like a good waiter refills your glass before you notice it's empty.
- **Subtractive over additive:** Remove steps from workflows. Why would I use your solution if it forces me to change a proven workflow I've committed to muscle memory? **Your software is not the gym.** (from [game design principles](https://www.sirlin.net/articles/subtractive-design))
- **Reusable by design:** Every project generates value beyond its immediate goal (infrastructure, knowledge, concepts). **Failure != lost work.**
- **Understand before automating:** Question whether problems should be solved, not just how. If your first idea is to throw AI at a problem, you're likely skipping the actual problem-solving. **AI works best on solid foundations, or it can just [make bad processes faster](https://errolallenconsulting.com/why-automation-will-not-improve-a-bad-process/).**
- **Solve problems worth solving:** I've found the most valuable solutions come from noticing friction in my own workflows that I'd adapted to without realizing, problems I didn't know I had until they were gone. The real challenge isn't building systems anymore, it's integrating into existing ones without breaking the user's flow.

[The best code I write is the code I don't have to write](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-best-code-is-no-code-at-all/). Most solutions don't need new infrastructure, they need someone who can see what's already there and repurpose it. **Why pay for lumber when you're standing in a forest?**

I bring lessons from music, athletics, psychology, and philosophy into technical work. Cross-domain thinking isn't decoration, it's how you spot patterns others miss. The best solutions come from understanding human behavior, not just technical specs. 

Prove your blocks are solid before building monuments. **Making your [quarter inch drill](https://www.library.hbs.edu/working-knowledge/what-customers-want-from-your-products) read the Tarot won't make a better quarter inch hole.** Congratulations, you just built a 10-wheeled bicycle that rides sideways, people will tell you how cool it looks and say you're clever, then they'll go back to riding their old trusties.

**All tech is debt until it becomes invisible. A chair is paid-off debt, you don't think about it until it breaks. Bad technology demands attention. The best technology integrates.**
